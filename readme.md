## P3 Developer's Best Friend 
Under construction: check in after 7/20 (hopefully)
Note from my mom: My dog ate it, uh, yeah. Actually, due to an overabundance work and life craziness, I will be passing in this project late over the weekend when he has a chance to figure it out. 

In the mean time: I got the packages installed, basic routes going but still got to do the logic and have a user able to choose.
