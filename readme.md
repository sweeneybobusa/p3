# P3 Developer's Best Friend 

## Under construction: check in after 7/20 (hopefully)

## live site (such as it is)
* [Developer's Best Friend index page](http://sweeneybobusa-p3.gopagoda.com/lorem-ipsum "Developer's best friend main page")
* [Lorem-ipsum](http://sweeneybobusa-p3.gopagoda.com/lorem-ipsum "Lorum Ipsum Generator")
* [User Generator](http://sweeneybobusa-p3.gopagoda.com/user-generator "User Generator")

##July 19 Update

###Here's what I got going so far: 
* Laravel installed an deployed.
* foundation installed and running for responsive design (only on index page at the moment).
* Base design for the index page (I'm in the process of making a master and use it as a template for the other pages).
* lorum-ipsum routing logic set for git ages validating for numerical, null, and non numeric variables beyond the / and hope to get that function as a class to use on the other pages.

### Here's my to do list:
* create views for secondary pages
* create classes for url number logic esp since the number thing is used on all three generators
* add base form to index, lorem, and user pages (put form would be basically the same as get for these)
* figure out how to target the panels on the index page. (if worse comes to worse, I'll just plunk the logic in it). 
* god, there's more too, isn't there?
